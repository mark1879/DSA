I slipped out a cigarette  
And slowly walked to the silent place  
It was deep in the night  
A cold breeze, a cheap plastic chair  
A mild cigarette

I smoked in the slow cool night blue breeze  
I smoked as the slow uncool night blue bloke  
I let the sadness in  
The walls propped for years, fixed there  
To prevent hurt, locking me in my head

Tears rolled down  
Rain or wet eyes  
The pain was too much  
The sadness infinite  
And in this moment  
I questioned life  
What is the point of living  
Suppose I got everything I wanted  
The whole world was at my dominion  
Absolute control and domination  
All the money I could ever want  
What then?  
Did I imagine myself happy?  
Maybe smug, but still sad.  
What was then the point of living?  
The pain reached a torment.  
Tears followed the path laid before them  
Two simple streaks of salted water rained my face  
Terrible and crushing pain  
Sadness  
And in this chaos of melancholy,  
Words popped up  
If I can write, paint, code,  
If I can do whatever I love,  
Then I am grateful to be alive.
