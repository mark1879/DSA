How should I say this  
This is simple to say  
But hard to say this  
There are so many ways  
But I can't find the right one

This isn't love  
And this is not  
less than love  
This is not like  
Since like is too small  
Compared to this

This is what I feel  
This is what I have  
All I have  
Is this

I don't know how to say this  
But I think  
you might understand  
This.
