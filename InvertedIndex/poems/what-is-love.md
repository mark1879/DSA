What is love?  
A dream? A hope? A person?  
You Me?  
We?  
Happiness? Sadness?  
A feeling? An emotion?  
A word? A sound?  
Chemicals? Instinct?  
Something I want to have?  
but not ready to give?  
Is it necessity? Or desire?  
A calm breeze or a bursting fire?  
Is it a word I can use to describe my state?  
Or an illusion?  
Is it lust? infatuation?  
Is it the songs? stories? poems?  
that we tell ourselves  
or the cards we send to each other?  
Sometimes it is in the air  
And sometimes I am in it.  
It is the color  
in the image of life.
