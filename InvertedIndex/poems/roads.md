There were two roads in the forest  
I took one, she took another  
We wandered for aeons  
Till our paths crossed.

We shared memories  
Of our travels  
Of our exploits  
Of the good days and the rainy ones  
We laughed and cried,  
For we had nothing to hide.

I couldn't walk on her path  
And neither could she traverse mine  
And so we parted again.

But I was too attached  
and tired of traveling all alone.  
So I tried traveling  
leaning towards her path  
while sticking on mine.

And through the thickest fauna  
I searched often where her path could have been  
for a glance of the familiar face  
amidst the darkness.

Sometimes I wondered,  
What if we never left the crossroads?

But it didn't matter  
The bend I was hoping for  
that would take me to her again  
never happened.

And neither did she encounter  
such a bend  
towards me.

I met other travelers  
And slowly she became  
from the traveler I met on the roads  
to a traveler I met on the roads.
