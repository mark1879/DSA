In a busy school,  
two friends sat together  
in mutual distrust.  
Each buying the same  
luxury pen last weekend  
and that hurt  
their swag level.

The first of the two  
used the pen far and few  
the second didn't.  
He abused the pen  
to scratches and scuffs  
having no care at all,  
for him, it was  
just another pen.


Days passed, Weeks passed.  
The first's pen shinned,  
where the seconds dulled.  
Jealousy rose again  
in second's heart.  
He was silent and discrete  
and switched his pen  
with the first's!


The first discovered however  
the second's crime.  
He ran to the teacher  
with teenage whine.  
The teacher was already tired  
Said that the pens were the same  
and punished the first  
for being so lame.


The first swallowed the _truth_  
and took the pen that  
the second misused.  
He dumped the pen  
with scratches and scruffs  
into the dustbin  
even if it worked just fine  
"Because it wasn't mine".


The next day, the first returned  
Blood filled with anger  
and eyes with revenge.  
He took the pen  
that the second stole  
and twine in half  
the beauty parted in two.

He stood there  
with the pen he cared for  
for days, for weeks  
broken in his hands  
and eyes wet with tears.  
For love is strong  
but weak in the face of hate.
