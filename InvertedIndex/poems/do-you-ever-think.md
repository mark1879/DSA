Do you ever think about a blank page  
In front of you, with a pen beside it.

You can fill it with anything you like  
Anything that tickles your imagination.

You can write the best story ever written  
Or the best poem, the best song ever sung.

The page is empty in front of you,  
Begging you to fill it.

You can draw on it, the next masterpiece  
Something better than Mona Lisa, something better than Scream.

You can fold it still, into a paper plane,  
That can fly several feet in the air,  
To bring the joy that you have been missing  
All day long.
