I fall too soon and too deep  
Into waters I am unaware of.  
And I forget to swim  
When I need to.  
I inhale the water  
Knowing all well,  
that it isn't well.  
And then I cry,  
Try to find faults  
In others when I am wrong,  
And in myself when others have wronged.  
I find myself  
At crossroads  
Where every road is a bad omen.  
And yet, I have to choose one  
And I go on blindly  
Trusting  
That it will all be alright  
When nothing actually is  
Alright.  
I am as broken  
As I am perfect,  
Perfect imperfections.  
The more I know  
The less I understand.  
It feels like I am climbing  
Falling stairs.  
I try to find the key  
Key to success  
Key to happiness  
Key to satisfaction  
That I have lost  
Long ago, beyond recovery  
I try to have hope  
That I will find it  
Because  
Hope is all I have, and  
I don't want to be locked in.  
I try too much  
And do too little.
