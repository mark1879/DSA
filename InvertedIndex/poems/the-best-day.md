It always confuses me,  
What is the best day  
Of my life

The day when I first saw you  
Or the day when you first saw me

The day when I first talked to you  
Or the day when you called late night

The day when I asked you out  
Or the day when you helped me out

For all the days that are special  
The best is today  
For I have you here with me, today.
