What is right  
What is wrong  
What is the best and the worst  
Just imagination  
And selfishness

If it helps you  
It is good, to you, to everyone  
If it doesn't  
BAD!

What are ethics and morals  
Just tools for the enslaved  
To justify the fantasies  
That they desire

What are slaves  
But people trapped in time  
With conditions  
Conditionally questionable

Why is killing bad  
And everyone still wants war

Why is rape not good  
When it is all democratic

Why is lying bad  
When it puts a smile  
On the old mans face  
And a tear in mom's eyes

Then what should we do?  
Whatever that lets you sleep at night  
And dream during the day is right
